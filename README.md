**1 - What is Codewars?**

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment. On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions.

**2 - How can I use this code?**
 
 Each folder is a challenge level, for example: 8kyu is the easiest level, where you can find challenges to train fundamentals of that language, and the 1kyu its the most hardest, with complex problems. So, if you have ou already did a challenge, you can came here and find that challenge and copy the code to submit as an answer or refactor.
 
 **3 - What's the benefit to solve these problems?**
 
 - You can learn new methods from a language, don't be afraid in search if you don't know well, the goal is to learn!
 - Train your logic to solve problems, even if these problems in Codewars you'll never experience in a real job, you'll be prepared to think in the correct way to solve real problems.
 - Also, its fun! :)
